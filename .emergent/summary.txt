The previous AI engineer successfully brought the WorkMe application from concept to a beta-ready state, integrating core functionalities as per user-defined phases. The process involved a clear, incremental development strategy, prioritizing authentication, payments, professional profiles, and AI matching. Throughout the trajectory, the AI engineer diligently addressed explicit user requests, installing necessary dependencies, modifying both backend (FastAPI/MongoDB) and frontend (Expo/React Native) code, and performing both unit and end-to-end tests. A significant refactor of the frontend navigation was observed to accommodate new screens. The work concluded with the AI starting the setup for a controlled beta test environment, specifically working on frontend feedback and analytics. A MongoDB connectivity issue was noted during the final AI matching tests, which remains to be fully resolved.

The user wants to create WorkMe, a mobile application connecting clients to service professionals. It needs two user profiles: client and professional. Clients can search, view ratings, hire, pay, and review services. Professionals can create profiles, submit documents for verification, receive/accept orders, and get paid. All payments are in-app with escrow until service completion. A digital wallet supporting Pix, credit card, and cashback is required. The design should be minimalist, primarily black/grey, with vibrant action buttons.

**Key Features Implemented/Requested:**
*   **Authentication**: Differentiated registration/login for clients and professionals.
*   **User Profiles**: Basic and detailed profiles for professionals, including portfolio, documents (RG/CNH, CPF, residence proof, selfie with document, optional certificates), and professional credentials (experience, specialties, prices, availability). Manual admin verification for documents.
*   **Service Categories**: Initial categories like Casa & Construção, Limpeza, Beleza & Bem-estar, Tecnologia & Suporte, Cuidados com Pets, Eventos.
*   **Payment System**: In-app payments via Stripe (with Pix support), digital wallet (deposit via Pix/card, cashback), 5% platform fee, 2% cashback, and escrow for secure transactions.
*   **AI Integration**: Smart matching (client to professional) and chatbot for support using Emergent LLM.
*   **Administrative Panel**: For manual document verification (approve/reject with feedback) and basic metrics (users, services, transactions).
*   **Beta Test Environment**: Controlled setup with a staging environment, embedded feedback tool, detailed usage logs, simplified admin panel for beta, and controlled invites.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: Expo (React Native), Expo Router (file-based routing), React Navigation (Stack/Tab Navigators), Zustand (state management), .
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (database), JWT (authentication), Stripe SDK (payment processing), ,  (LLM integration).
- **Core Features**: Authentication, authorization (JWT), user profiles, payment escrow, digital wallet, AI-powered matching, document/image upload (Base64).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project has a monorepo-like structure with  and  directories at the root level of .



-   : This is the core FastAPI backend file.
    -   **Summary**: Handles all API endpoints, including user authentication (register, login, JWT token generation), user profile management, service categories, wallet and transaction management (deposits, withdrawals, escrow), Stripe integration, document and portfolio uploads (Base64), and AI matching (using Emergent LLM). It also manages MongoDB interactions for various collections (users, profiles, wallets, transactions, bookings, documents, portfolio, etc.).
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified throughout the trajectory to add authentication, user models, service categories, payment processing, escrow, document/portfolio management, and AI matching endpoints. Also updated for beta environment configuration.
-   : Environment variables for the backend.
    -   **Summary**: Contains  and .
    -   **Changes**:  was added to enable AI functionalities. Updated for beta environment configurations.
-   : The main entry point for the Expo Router frontend.
    -   **Summary**: Initially the single entry file, it was refactored to set up the main navigation structure (Root Navigator) and integrate the  to manage user sessions and route protection.
    -   **Changes**: Transformed from a basic screen into a complex navigation hub, handling authenticated vs. unauthenticated states and defining  and .
-   : Manages user authentication state.
    -   **Summary**: Provides a React Context for authentication, allowing different parts of the application to access user login status, token, and user type (client/professional).
    -   **Changes**: Created to encapsulate authentication logic and state.
-    (e.g., , , , , , , , , , , , ): These files represent the various screens/pages of the mobile application.
    -   **Summary**: Each file implements a specific UI screen, handles user interactions, and interacts with the backend APIs. They adhere to the minimalist design guidelines and utilize React Native components.
    -   **Changes**: All these files were created progressively to implement the features of Phase 1 (Auth), Phase 5 (Payments), Phase 2 (Detailed Profiles), and Phase 4 (AI Matching). Navigation between these screens was also configured and updated iteratively.
-   : Manages frontend dependencies.
    -   **Summary**: Lists all libraries required for the Expo React Native application.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include , , , and other necessary libraries.
-   : Documentation for testing protocols and results.
    -   **Summary**: Used by the AI engineer to log test instructions and report outcomes of backend and end-to-end tests.
    -   **Changes**: Updated after each testing phase to reflect the status of implemented functionalities.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently working on setting up the controlled Beta Test Environment for the WorkMe application. This involves:

1.  **Staging Environment Configuration**: The backend ( and ) has been updated to support an isolated staging environment and specific configurations for beta testing.
2.  **Embedded Feedback System and Analytics**: The AI engineer just stated, Agora vou implementar o sistema de feedback embutido e analytics no frontend:. This indicates the immediate next task involves modifying frontend files (likely existing screens or creating new components/utilities) to add a feedback mechanism and integrate usage tracking.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Implement the frontend components for the embedded feedback tool and detailed usage analytics.
